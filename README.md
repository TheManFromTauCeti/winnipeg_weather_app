Winnipeg Weather Processor
==========================

This application is for scrapping weather data from the Government of Canda's website and processing the data to generate 
monthly and yearly graphs for analysis. It's currently set to scrape data for Winnipeg Manitoba, but could be adjusted if required. 

I developed this application for my final project for a Python class I took at Red River College :)

How it works
------------

This application does three things. 

First, it scrapes weather data from the Government of Canda's website via [HTMLParser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html).

Second, it processes the data by filtering out bad data (i.e. nulls and non-numerics). The data is stored in an SQLite database.

Third, the application will generate either box plots or a line plots depending on user input. Users can either request graphs for monthly average 
temperature from a set of years (e.g. 1999 â€“ 2003) or a daily average temperatures for a specific month (e.g. January 2009).
